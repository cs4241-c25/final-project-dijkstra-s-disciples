**Description**
-

   CueSportsPro is a sophisticated tournament management system with role-based access control for players and 
tournament officials. The platform enables tournament officials to create customizable tournaments 
with different rule sets (8-Ball, 9-Ball, or 10-Ball), scoring configurations, and skill-level brackets. Players 
can register for upcoming tournaments, view past tournaments, view ongoing bracket, and track their performance history. When 
tournaments are in session, the system provides real-time bracket visualization with automatic progression 
as officials record match results, creating an engaging and transparent tournament experience for all participants
and spectators.

   Beyond tournament management, CueSportsPro delivers comprehensive player profiles with detailed match histories, 
win/loss statistics, and performance analytics across different rule sets. The platform maintains an archive of past 
tournaments with complete results and winner information for historical reference. Users can customize notification 
preferences to stay informed about tournament registrations, and upcoming matches. The elegant user interface, 
featuring subtle animations, textured backgrounds, and carefully crafted typography, ensures an intuitive and visually 
appealing experience across all devices.

**Additional instructions for CueSportsPro**
-
1. To login, click the sign-in button in the upper right corner and then click on Sign In With Google when redirected
2. Make sure you have a Google account when testing player and tournament official functionality or you cannot login
3. Only tournament-officials have access to functions like creating tournaments which is not given by default. We can elevate your account to tournament official status for your testing if you ask prior.

**Technology Stack**
-
- Glitch - We deployed to Glitch to make it readily accessible to anyone with the url
- Tailwind CSS - We used Tailwind CSS to streamline the appearance of our application making it look more professional
- MongoDB - We used MongoDB to store complex datastructures like the user and tournament information allowing for access control based on the user's role
- Google OAuth - We used Google authentication as we deemed most people would have a Google account and it allowed for access control on our application
- Jira - We used Jira to manage our sprint and organize our team throughout the development of this application
- GitHub - We used GitHub to manage version control throughout development and manage merge conflicts
- Nodemailer + smtp - We used Nodemailer to send notifications to users when tournaments are created and started

**Challenges**
-
- Deployment: Deploying on Glitch was a long and painful process
- Email Notifications: Email notification system to message people when tournaments are created or started
- Bracket Creation: Dynamic Bracket Generation for any amount of players between 4 and 32.
- Authentication: Setting up Google OAuth to allow for verification through Google
